# Sentence Classification
In this document, nine different sentence classification methods, including SVM, CNN, LSTM, and others, have been implemented, and their accuracy has been compared.
For the first six algorithms, the TF-IDF method has been used for word embedding, while One-Hot encoding has been applied to the remaining three methods. Other potential embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and ParsBert, could potentially yield better results and higher accuracy.
